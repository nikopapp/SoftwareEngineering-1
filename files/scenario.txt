Data Forest

Once upon a time there was a 
little red haired elf who only 
wished good. Whenever she had no 
plans she wandered around the 
Data Forest, a place not far
from where the Data elves live and
prosper. This place is amazing, 
it’s full of bits and calculations
and permanent movement, so complex
that appears to be utterly random but
nevertheless perfect. Well it’s not 
random at all, it’s a result of 
coordination and sequence of actions
rigorously performed by every single
part of the Forest. This order is
impossible to see unless one has 
listened and deciphered the secrets
of the Great Mother Forest Board.

Sound like a challenge?

Try to help our little elf 
repair the damage caused by
the great thunderstorm. It won't 
be easy since many calculations
have been left incomplete and many words 
including data and instructions. 
Bassically, whatever maintains 
this complex system running smoothly.

Go deep into the Data Path and 
try to restore some order. 
Each time you play the game you
help a Data Cycle Path to 
be completed and bring harmony 
to the forest again.

If you and your friends help our 
hero complete as many cycles as possible 
everything will run smoothly once again.
