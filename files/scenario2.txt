Data Forest

Once upon a time there was a little
red haired elf who only wished good.
Whenever she had no plans she wandered
around the Data Forest, a place not far
from where the Data elves live and
prosper. This place is amazing, 
it’s full of bits and calculations
and permanent movement, so complex
that appears to be utterly random but
nevertheless perfect. Well it’s not 
random at all, it’s a result of 
coordination and sequence of actions
rigorously performed by every single
part of the Forest. This order is
impossible to see unless one has 
listened and deciphered  the secrets
of the Great Mother Forest Board.

Sound like a challenge?

Try to help our little elf repair the
damage caused by the great thunderstorm. 
It won't be easy since many calculations
have been left incomplete and many words 
including data and instructions. Bassically,
whatever maintains this complex system 
running smoothly.

Go deep into the Data Path and try to create
some order. Each time you play the game you
help a Data Cycle Path to be completed and 
bring harmony to the forest again.

If you and your friends help our little elf
complete as many cycles as possible everything 
will run smoothly once again.
